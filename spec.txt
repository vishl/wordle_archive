 - do a better job of splitting auth from db



1. send a link to someone to be added to their friends list
2. they will also be added to your friends list
3. you can remove people from your friends list
4. if someone is on your friends list, you can see their game history
5. if you have completed the puzzle for that day, you can see the words that they chose
6. at the end of a game, you can leave a comment that your friends can see, up to 80 characters

The game state stores the following:
